# Weather Dashboard

## Description 

The aim of this project was to build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser using the OpenWeather API.

## Usage 

When the user searches for a City, they are presented with the current temperature, wind speed and humidity for that City with an icon representing the current weather condition.

They are also presented with a 5-Day weather forecast, with each card showing the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, as well as the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

Each City that is searched is also saved to the local storage and then presented as a clickable button. When each button is clicked, the user is then presented with the weather for that City again.
